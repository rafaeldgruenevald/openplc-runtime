#   - run per-file compilation in parallel via `-j$(nproc)` (Pi 4 = 4×,
#     workstations more);
#   - reuse cached .o files automatically when ccache is installed,
#     so incremental rebuilds (one POU edited) drop from minutes to
#     a few seconds;
#   - adapt to whatever .cpp set STruC++'s codegen split emitted —
#     the Makefile uses `wildcard $(GENERATED_DIR)/*.cpp` rather than
#     a hard-coded list.
#
# The MatIEC-era files (Config0.c, Res0.c, debug.c, glueVars.c) are
# rejected with a clear error so stale uploads fail loudly instead of
# silently building against the old pipeline.

# Build the program — actual rules live in scripts/Makefile.strucpp.
#
# Pick the build parallelism (`-j`) as min(CPU cap, memory cap). Both
# are real constraints on the Pi-class targets we ship to, and either
# bound alone has caused field outages.
#
# CPU cap = nproc - 1.  On a 4-core Pi 4 `-j$(nproc)` saturates every
# core with g++ and starves the webserver / runtime monitor of CPU
# during the compile; combined with the Pi's slow SD-card swap, that
# made port-8443 RST new connections for 60+ seconds while the compile
# thrashed. Reserving one core for the Flask webserver, the runtime
# monitor thread, and any plugins keeps the device responsive
# throughout — only ~25 % slower per build on a Pi 4.
#
# Memory cap = total RAM (rounded to nearest GB) — one parallel job
# per gigabyte.  Each cc1plus invocation on OpenPLC-generated TUs
# peaks at ~500–700 MB on a Pi 4.  With `-j3` on a 2 GB device,
# three concurrent cc1pluses exhaust RAM + swap and the system enters
# a swap-thrash deadlock where no compile process makes progress —
# requires a physical reboot to recover on a headless target.
# Capping at one job per GB gives ~500 MB per cc1plus + headroom for
# the kernel, the webserver, the PLC core, and the plugins.  The
# `+512` before dividing rounds MemTotal to the nearest GB so a 2 GB
# Pi (which reports ~1.8 GiB usable after kernel reserves) doesn't
# get wrongly demoted to -j1.
#
# Floor at 1 so single-core or sub-GB targets don't end up with `-j0`
# (which means "unlimited" in GNU make, i.e. fork-bomb).
#
# Worked examples:
#   Pi 4 2 GB (nproc=4): cpu=3, mem=2 → -j2
#   Pi 4 4 GB (nproc=4): cpu=3, mem=4 → -j3
#   Pi 4 8 GB (nproc=4): cpu=3, mem=8 → -j3
#   1 GB / 1 core VM:    cpu=1, mem=1 → -j1
#   Workstation 8c/16GB: cpu=7, mem=16 → -j7
